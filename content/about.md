Welcome to my corner of the digital world! I'm Marcin Cylke 👋, a multifaceted individual with a passion for software development 💻, the written word 📚, outdoor adventures 🏃‍♂️, and the nostalgic charm of retro computers 🕹️.

Professionally, I thrive in the realm of software development, where I craft elegant solutions to complex problems, fueled by creativity and a meticulous attention to detail. From designing user-friendly interfaces to optimizing backend processes, I love diving into the intricacies of code and technology to bring ideas to life.

Beyond the screen, you'll often find me immersed in the pages of a book, exploring diverse worlds and perspectives crafted by talented authors. Whether it's delving into the classics or discovering hidden gems in contemporary literature, I find solace and inspiration within the pages of countless stories.

But my love for adventure doesn't stop at the turn of a page. I'm also an avid trail runner, seeking the tranquility and challenge of nature's paths. Whether winding through forests, scaling mountains, or tracing along coastal routes, each run is a journey of self-discovery and connection to the world around me.

And then there's my affinity for retro computers, a fascination with the technological relics of the past that laid the groundwork for today's digital landscape. From tinkering with vintage hardware to exploring nostalgic software, I find joy in preserving and celebrating the pioneering spirit of early computing.

In this space, I invite you to join me on a journey where bytes, books, trails, and retro computers converge, each element shaping my identity and enriching my experiences. Let's explore, create, and connect in this ever-evolving digital tapestry together. 🌟
