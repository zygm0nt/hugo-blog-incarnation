{{< book_review title="Czysta Ameryka. Przemilczana historia eugeniki" book_cover="/post_images/books-i-read-oct-dec-2024-0.png" author="Elizabeth Catte"  >}}
- Many interesting observations and a clearly presented opinion on eugenics and its history in the USA. It's quite difficult to get through due to the many facts specific to USA internal politics. It also explores topics loosely connected to eugenics, which may feel tangential but provide a broader context. There is certainly a lot of personal opinions here, referring to the author's hometown. It makes the book less valuable as an objective study of the subject, and more just a personal exploration based on local facts."

{{< book_review title="Zakamarki Białego Domu" book_cover="/post_images/books-i-read-oct-dec-2024-1.png" author="Marek Wałkuski"  >}}
- written as a concise trivia book about US White House. The author, polish correspondent working in the Presidential Press Pool shares a lot of his personal experiences, but also adds a lot of smaller research to that. The mix of personal anecdotes and research makes the book both engaging and informative. However, Some sections feel less compelling and might serve more as filler. While accurate, the repeated mention of being the only Polish reporter near the US President can feel overemphasized.

- how AI is changing the world, and what will be its future influence. Written by an influential person, a co-founder of DeepMind. The book presents thought-provoking insights, particularly on societies' approach to that new paradigm (AI). Given the rapid evolution of AI, some ideas in the book have already become outdated. Some ideas in the book are already out of sync with what's happening in the industry. This book has been a good, relaxing exercise for the mind. While it's an engaging read, some ideas may feel more speculative than definitive.

{{< book_review title="Umbrella Academy" book_cover="/post_images/books-i-read-oct-dec-2024-3.png" author="Gerard Way, 	Gabriel Bá"  >}}
- before the Netflix series there's been a comic version of the story about the patchwork family of super-children, born on the same day all around the world. I really liked the Netflix adaptation, after enjoying the Netflix adaptation, I was inspired to explore the original comic. And that's been a good decision, I must say. In fact, The comic offers richer character development and a more intricate storyline compared to the Netflix adaptation. The unique art style and imaginative storytelling made it a thoroughly enjoyable read.

{{< book_review title="Futuro Darko" book_cover="/post_images/books-i-read-oct-dec-2024-4.png" author="Krzysztof Nowak"  >}}
- A post-apocalyptic comic with a distinctly Polish twist. The album contains a bunch of separate stories connected by the main characters. I enjoyed the style of the comics. Also, the comic-inspired soundtrack adds an immersive dimension to the reading experience.! Neat idea!
