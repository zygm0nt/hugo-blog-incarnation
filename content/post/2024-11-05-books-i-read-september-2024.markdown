## Books

{{< book_review title="Stany podzielone Ameryki" book_cover="/post_images/books-i-read-september-2024-0.png" author="Lukasz Pawłowski"  >}}
- Written by one of the podcasters from "Podcast amerykański," and my great experience with this book was largely due to this connection. The book is fascinating and feels refreshingly objective.
- Additionally, it offers an insightful analysis of the current state of American society, particularly from a European perspective, providing a unique outsider's view of the country's complexities.

{{< book_review title="Persepolis" book_cover="/post_images/books-i-read-september-2024-1.png" author="Marjane Satrapi"  >}}
- A classic. This graphic novel chronicles the experience of growing up and living in Iran before, during, and after the Islamic Revolution. The most vivid and shocking part of the story takes place in Iran.
- The second part, about living in Austria as an immigrant, is less engaging. I found it most enjoyable when the action returned to Iran, highlighting the stark contrast between the two countries, and more importantly, the people.
- Highly recommended!

{{< book_review title="Blankets" book_cover="/post_images/books-i-read-september-2024-2.png" author="Craig Thompson"  >}}
- An autobiographical graphic novel that tells the story of growing up in a deeply religious family and how it shaped the author's first love and transition to adulthood.
- Not my favorite.

{{< book_review title="Ghostmoney" book_cover="/post_images/books-i-read-september-2024-3.png" author="Smolderen & Bertail"  >}}
- I really enjoyed this graphic novel. It's set in the near future and follows a wild chase for lost Al-Qaeda money. The story is told from multiple perspectives, involving politics and a somewhat exaggerated portrayal of shady U.S. dealings around the world.
- The art style is atmospheric, with some parts being quite dark and gritty, while others depict futuristic, beautifully rendered Middle Eastern cities.
- As for the plot—it's not too deep, but it’s still enjoyable.

{{< book_review title="Sandworm" book_cover="/post_images/books-i-read-september-2024-4.png" author="Andy Greenberg"  >}}
- A brilliant book that dives into the dangers of cyberwarfare. It covers nation-sponsored cyberattacks on infrastructure and emphasizes the urgent need for securing networks. The book paints a grim picture of potential future cyberattacks, especially with state-sponsored groups using zero-day vulnerabilities against individuals and institutions.
- It reads like a thriller, except the stakes are real.
- I'd compare it to Kim Zetter's *Countdown to Zero Day* about Stuxnet. Personally, I would have enjoyed more technical details, but it was a great read nonetheless.
